# Pokemon Team Builder - Pair Programming Exercise

## Your Mission ðŸŽ¯

You're working on a Pokemon team building app. Some functions are complete, some have bugs, and some are missing entirely. Your job: **fix, complete, and test everything!**

## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming

```bash
git switch -c ticket-1-filter-tests
```

### Commit Messages (Examples)

```bash
git commit -m "test: add water type filter test"
git commit -m "test: add empty array edge case for filterByType"
git commit -m "fix: handle ties in getStrongestPokemon function"
git commit -m "feat: implement sortByName with immutable sort"
```

### Push Your Work

```bash
git push origin ticket-1-filter-tests
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub!

## Tips

- **Read error messages** - they tell you what's broken
- **Use Copilot and even Warp** for help, but make sure you understand the code. You are not to modify any of the MD files. You are not to use any other external AI ðŸ¤– resources.
- **Commit frequently** - after each small win
- **Driver/Navigator**: Switch roles every 15 minutes

Good luck! ðŸš€
